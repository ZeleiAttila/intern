//--- STEP 00 - WHAT IS LOOSE COUPLING? 
//---------------------------------------

///**
//* Loose Coupling = Low dependencies between “artifacts” (classes, modules, components).
//* 
//* Avoid tight-coupling for collaboration between two classes (if one class wants to call the logic of a second class, then they first class needs an
//* object of second class it means the first class creates an object of second class).
//* 
//* Strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact.
//* 
//* Inversion Of Control (IoC) / Dependency Injection (DI) - With DI objects are given their dependencies at creation time by some third party (i.e.
//* Java EE CDI, Spring DI…) that coordinates each object in the system. Objects aren’t expected to create or obtain their dependencies—dependencies
//* are injected into the objects that need them. The key benefit of DI—loose coupling.

public class LooseCouplingTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Example of tight coupling - To change journey from Car to Bike, it
		// requires changes in BadTraveler class
		BadTraveler bt = new BadTraveler();
		bt.startJourney();
		// Example of loose coupling - To change journey from Car to Bike, it is
		// possible without changing GoodTraveler class
		GoodTraveler gt = new GoodTraveler();
		gt.setV(new Car()); // Inject Car dependency
		gt.startJourney(); // start journey by Car
		gt.setV(new Bike()); // Inject Bike dependency
		gt.startJourney(); // Start journey by Bike

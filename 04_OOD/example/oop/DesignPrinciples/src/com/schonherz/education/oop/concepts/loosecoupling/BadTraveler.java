/**
 * This is example of tight coupling. Here to start journey, the BadTraveler
 * class is creating Car object to interact with it using move() method. Hence
 * both are tightly coupled. Now if there is a need to change journey from Car
 * to Bike, then it requires to do changes in BadTraveler class (i.e. replace
 * Car object with Bike object). Hence tight coupling should be avoided.

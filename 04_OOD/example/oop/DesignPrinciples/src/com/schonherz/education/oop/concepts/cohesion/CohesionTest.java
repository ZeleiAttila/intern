//--- STEP 00 - WHAT IS HIGH COHESION? 
//---------------------------------------

///**
//* High Cohesion = The responsibilities/methods are highly related to class/module.
//* 
//* The term cohesion is used to indicate the degree to which a class has a single, well-focused. Cohesion is a measure of how the methods of a class 
//* or a module are meaningfully and strongly related and how focused they are in providing a well-defined purpose to the system. The more focused a 
//* class is, the higher its cohesiveness - a good thing.
//* 
//* A class is identified as a low cohesive class, when it contains many unrelated functions within it. And that what we need to avoid, because big
//* classes with unrelated functions hamper their maintaining. Always make your class small and with precise purpose and highly related functions.

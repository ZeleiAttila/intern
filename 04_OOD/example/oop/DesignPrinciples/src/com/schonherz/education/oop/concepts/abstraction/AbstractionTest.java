//* Abstraction = Looking only at the information that is relevant at the time. 
//*
//* Abstraction is the process or result of generalization by reducing the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon, 
//* typically in order to retain only information which is relevant for a particular purpose. It is starting point of design.
//* Functional abstraction - means that a function can be used without taking into account how the function is implemented. 
//* Data Abstraction - means that data can be used without taking into account how the data are stored.

///**
//* Encapsulation = Data hiding mechanism.
//*
//* The process of binding or wrapping the data and the codes that operates on the data into a single entity. This keeps the data safe from 
//* outside interface and misuse. One way to think about encapsulation is as a protective wrapper that prevents code and data from being arbitrarily 
//* accessed by other code defined outside the wrapper. 
//* For example - if a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class.
